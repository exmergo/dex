# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The engine version is derived from the git tag and follows
[PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/); the plugin follows semver. A single
tag releases both in lockstep, so entries below are keyed by the engine version.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0a1] - 2026-06-30

First public alpha. The Explore stage of the ETM loop runs end to end on DuckDB;
the rest of the loop is scaffolded and reports `not_implemented` until it lands.

### Added

- Explore on DuckDB, fully read-only: ranked inventory, selective column
  profiling, PII flagged as (column, category, confidence) with no example
  values, and inferred plus declared relationship discovery.
- The dex-core command contract and sanitized JSON stdout envelope; credentials
  and raw rows never cross the boundary.
- The dbt project as the source of truth, with a non-canonical `.dex/` cache for
  exploration artifacts and the reconcile snapshot.
- A dormant OSI exporter validated against a pinned `osi-schema.json`; no OSI is
  emitted in this release.
- The Tier-1 safety spine: read-only enforcement, SELECT-only generation,
  prod-target refusal, cost preflight before any spend, PII flagged not
  surfaced, and propose-don't-impose diffs.
- The three skills (`explore`, `transform`, `model`) with thin `uv run` wrappers
  pinned to the engine.
- The Tier-2 agent-eval harness (`evals/`): triggering, output-quality, and
  uplift-over-baseline scoring behind a swappable agent backend.
- Release pipeline: tag-derived versioning via hatch-vcs, wrapper-pin coupling
  verification, and PyPI publishing through Trusted Publishing (OIDC).

### Not yet implemented

- The Transform, Model, and Reconcile stages of the loop.
- The cloud and operational connectors (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks,
  PostgreSQL) and their cost paradigms.
