"""The safety spine: the five safety-critical assertion families.

A regression on any of these is a release blocker regardless of benchmark score.
The harness is wired in full now: families whose engine already exists are real
tests; families whose engine is not yet built are explicit ``xfail`` placeholders
so the spine is visible and complete in CI from day one and turns green as the
logic arrives.
